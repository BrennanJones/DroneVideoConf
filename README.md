# DroneVideoConf

This is the source code to a research prototype of a mobile video conferencing system utilizing a drone. This system supports video conferencing scenarios where there is one party at a desktop and another party in a large outdoor space with a smartphone and a drone. The drone autonomously follows the field party around, providing a complementary view of them from up above. This view can allow the desktop party to see things in the remote environment from perspectives that the person on the ground would not be able to attain.

This is a work-in-progress. More details on how to set up and run the system will be included here in the near future.

*Please note that this is a prototype, and as such will not always work perfectly. Expect issues to occur. I am not liable for any damages that occur from the use of this prototype.*
